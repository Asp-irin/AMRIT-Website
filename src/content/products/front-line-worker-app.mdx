The Front Line Worker (FLW) mobile application is designed to digitally empower ASHA workers to streamline data capture and improve healthcare service delivery at the community level. This application reduces duplication, minimizes manual labor, and enhances ASHA efficiency by providing a digital tool for data collection related to noncommunicable diseases, maternal and child health, family planning, immunization, and more.

The application is primarily used by ASHA workers to register beneficiaries, monitor health statuses, and provide appropriate care within communities. It supports full-service tracking under the Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health (RMNCH) program, covering antenatal, postnatal, delivery services, and immunizations. The platform’s localization ensures easy usage, with versions available in Hindi and Assamese to accommodate linguistic diversity. Additionally, ANMs, block, and district officials can use this data to identify health trends and manage health programs more effectively across the population.
