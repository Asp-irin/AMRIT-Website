The Mobile Medical Unit (MMU) application is an integral part of the AMRIT platform (Accessible Medical Records via Integrated Technologies), designed to extend healthcare access to remote and underserved communities. The application enables real-time and offline data capture, allowing health workers to register beneficiaries, record vital health data, and create Electronic Health Records (EMRs) for each patient. This digital solution enhances the clinical management of diseases and ensures continuity of care by maintaining a centralized health database.

The MMU solution is integrated with other healthcare services, ensuring a coordinated care network. Beneficiaries can be referred to:
