<strong>The Challenge</strong>
When a patient revisits a health and wellness center, healthcare workers need to look up their information quickly and efficiently. Without an optimized search mechanism, the process can be cumbersome, leading to potential data duplication if the patient is registered again. This challenge is especially prominent in rural and remote areas where efficient data management is critical.

<strong>The Solution: Facial Recognition Technology</strong>
To address this challenge, integrating facial recognition technology into the HWC Mobile Application offers a solution. By allowing Community Health Officers (CHO) to quickly capture and identify patient facial biometrics, the app can:
<ul>
<li>Instantly retrieve registered patient details</li>
<li>Autofill revisit forms</li>
<li>Access the patient's medical history</li>
<li>Prevent duplicate registrations</li>
</ul>
This addition will not only ease the workflow of health workers but also improve the experience for thousands of beneficiaries during their revisits.
