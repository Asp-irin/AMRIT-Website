The Health and Wellness Centre (HWC) Application is a critical component of the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM), developed to deliver Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC) services. The app is designed to support the HWC initiative, which focuses on providing an extensive range of healthcare services—beyond maternal and child healthcare—to communities. It includes preventive, promotive, curative, rehabilitative, and palliative care, with an emphasis on wellness. The application aims to bring these services closer to the community, ensuring access to essential drugs and diagnostic services, even in rural and remote areas.

In this blog post, we will explore the features of the HWC mobile app and discuss future enhancements required to overcome challenges in data sharing in fully offline environments



Current Features of the HWC Application
The HWC Mobile App is equipped with both offline and online capabilities, designed to work seamlessly in areas with limited network availability. Here’s what the app currently offers:

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Offline Data Storage and Workflow Management:</strong> The app allows health workers to store data locally on a single device, enabling them to complete the entire workflow even without network connectivity.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Data Syncing to AMRIT Server:</strong> When a network becomes available, the locally stored data is synced to the AMRIT server, ensuring that all health records are up-to-date and accessible for healthcare delivery.
