The AMRIT project, developed by Piramal Swasthya, aims to transform healthcare delivery in India through technology. To ensure that AMRIT remains efficient and scalable, we are enhancing its CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipeline. This blog post dives into the goals, technical implementation, and expected outcomes of the CI/CD pipeline enhancement project, highlighting its impact on AMRIT's overall efficiency.

The project aims to enhance the CI/CD pipeline for AMRIT, a healthcare platform by Piramal Swasthya. The primary goals include researching and selecting the appropriate CI/CD tools, understanding current deployments, and modifying GitHub Actions to trigger unit testing and static code analysis. The development includes setting up a Jenkins pipeline for building WAR files, managing database schema migrations, and deploying these files to a WildFly server in the development environment. The CI/CD workflow will be streamlined for higher environments with minimal manual intervention.

Delivering comprehensive documentation detailing the CI/CD tools, pipeline setup, configurations, and usage instructions. The outcome includes a Jenkins setup where a few clicks will build and deploy the latest code to designated data centers, automating code testing, building, and deployment processes.


<strong>Project Overview</strong> <br/>
The CI/CD pipeline enhancement project is designed to automate and optimize the deployment processes for AMRIT. The goal is to implement modern DevOps practices to minimize manual intervention, reduce deployment times, and enhance the reliability of code delivery.

Key Objectives:
<ul>
<li>Research and select appropriate CI/CD tools suitable for AMRITâ€™s deployment architecture.</li>
<li>Understand the existing deployments to integrate the pipeline seamlessly.</li>
<li>Modify GitHub Actions to include automated unit testing and static code analysis.</li>
<li>Set up a Jenkins pipeline to build WAR files, deploy them to WildFly, and handle database schema migrations automatically.</li>
</ul>
